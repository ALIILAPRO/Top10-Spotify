# Top 10 Songs from Spotify's "Top 50 Global" Playlist

This Python script uses the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) to fetch the top 10 songs from Spotify's "Top 50 Global" playlist, and displays them in a nice, formatted table.

## Getting Started

To use this script, you will first need to obtain your own Spotify API credentials by creating a developer account on the [Spotify for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/) website. Once you have your credentials, replace the `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` and `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET` placeholders in the code with your actual client ID and client secret, respectively.

You will also need to have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your computer, as well as the [requests library](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) (which you can install via pip).

## Usage

To run the script, simply open a terminal or command prompt window, navigate to the directory where the script is located, and type the following command:

```python
python top10.py
```
